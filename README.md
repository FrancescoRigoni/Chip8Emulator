Chip8 platform emulator
====================================
An emulator for the Chip8 platform written in Scala.
This was my first emulator, and also my first real Scala project.

To build the emulator you need to make sure you have `scalac` and `sbt`, then run:
```
$ sbt compile
```

To run the emulator use the `startemu.sh` script
```
$  ./startemu.sh chip-8-roms/games/Space\ Invaders\ \[David\ Winter\].ch8
```
You can also import the project in IntelliJ.
