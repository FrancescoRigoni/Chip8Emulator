Chip8 platform emulator
====================================
An emulator for the Chip8 platform written in Scala.
This was my first emulator, ans also my first real Scala project. It works fairly well, however there are still a few small
bugs which I'm investigating and will hopefully fix.

To build the emulator you need to make sure you have `scalac` and `sbt`, then run:
```
$ sbt compile
```

To run the emulator use `sbt run`
```
sbt "run astrododge.ch8"
```
